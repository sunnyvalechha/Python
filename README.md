- Variables & Data Types:

* **Variables** used to temporary store the value of a data-type. 
* **Data-type:** Categorize the type of values a variable can hold. Below are the some commonly used data-types:
  
  1. integer (int)
  2. float
  3. string (str)
  4. boolean (bool)
  5. list
  6. tuple
  7. sets
  8. dictonary
  
 **Important:** Python is a dynamically typed programming language where we do not mention the data-type of a variable it automatically understands.

    name = "Sunny"
    Age = 35
    City = "Pune"
    Package = 18

    print(name)
    print(Age)
    print(City)
    print(Package)
